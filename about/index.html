	<h2>About us</h2>

	<p>
		Composed of an ethnically, culturally and gender-ly diverse, comprehenisve and supportive team of white males
		aged 16/17, TG Enterprise was hailed amongst Britain's business community for their pioneering attitude towards
		Human Resources (HR).
	</p>
	<p>
		The mystery of TG Enterprise's failure is one which still racks the brains of many intelligent people to this
		very day, as business experts and historians alike try desperately to untangle the twisted narrative. Suffice to
		say, it was not a glorious business.
