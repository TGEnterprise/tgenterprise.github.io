    <!--<p>
      Our company is proud of our ethnically, culturally and gender-ly diverse, comprehensive and supportive team of white males aged 16.

    <p>
      If you want a job here, e-mail Secretary of State for TG Enterprise at jobs@tgenterprise.co.uk, with the subject "I love white chocolate fingers.". This is case sensitive, and please remember to include your age, race as well as your parent's annual earnings, and understand that we do hold a large bias in these regards. If we do not respond to your e-mail withing 2000 working days, please call us on 0118 999 881 999 119 7253. If nobody answers, please assume that the business has failed, or the board of directors has been taken hostage by Daesh, whichever seems more likely at the current time. If neither of these seem probable, please try tweeting <a href="https://www.twitter.com/TGEnterpriseUK">@TGEnterpriseUK</a>.

    <p>
      Composed of an ethnically, culturally and gender-lyy diverse, comprehenisve and supportive team of white males aged 16/17, TG Enterprise was hailed amongst Britain's business community for their pioneering attitude towards Human Resources (HR).
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery of TG Enterprise's failure is one which still wracks the brains of many intelligent people to this very day, as business experts and historians try desparatly to untangle the twisted narrative. Suffice to say, it was not a glorius business.
