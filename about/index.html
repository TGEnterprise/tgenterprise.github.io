      If you want a job here, e-mail Secretary of State for TG Enterprise at jobs@tgenterprise.co.uk, with the subject "I love white chocolate fingers.". This is case sensitive, and please remember to include your age, race as well as your parent's annual earnings, and understand that we do hold a large bias in these regards. If we do not respond to your e-mail withing 2000 working days, please call us on 0118 999 881 999 119 7253. If nobody answers, please assume that the business has failed, or the board of directors has been taken hostage by Daesh, whichever seems more likely at the current time. If neither of these seem probable, please try tweeting <a href="https://www.twitter.com/TGEnterpriseUK">@TGEnterpriseUK</a>.
