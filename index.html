      TG Enterprise was founded on the 5th of October 2016, by Thomas George himself, as well as his trusted board of directors. We meet every week, and are constantly trying to come up with anything remotely better than a mother fucking hand on a mother fucking stick. Our current Managing Director is Marley Sudbury, who rules with compassion and justice, alongside his Assistant MD Jan Ilnicki.

      TG Enterprise was founded on the 5th of October 2016, by Thomas George (aka TG), as well as his trusted board of directors. In December 2016, after a <a href = "blog/#14/12/2016">leadership challenge</a>, Marley Sudbury became the Managing Director, a decision most people regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st of March 2017, after months of hardship, and with most members having jumped ship, TG Enterprise finally ceased to be. Most people didn't really care, continuing the trend they had followed since day one.
