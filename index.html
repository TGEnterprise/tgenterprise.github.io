      TG Enterprise was founded on the 5th of October 2016, by Thomas George himself, as well as his trusted board of directors. We meet every week, and are constantly trying to come up with anything remotely better than a mother fucking hand on a mother fucking stick. Our current Managing Director is Marley Sudbury, who rules with compassion and justice, alongside his Assistant MD Jan Ilnicki.
