		TG Enterprise was founded on the 5th of October 2016, by Tommy G. (TG for short), as well as his trusted board
		of
		directors. In December 2016, after a <a href="blog/#14/12/2016">leadership challenge</a>, Marley Sudbury became
		the Managing Director, a decision most people regret.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the 1st of March 2017, after months of hardship, and with most members having jumped ship, TG Enterprise
		finally ceased to be. Most people didn't really care, continuing the trend they had followed since day one.
