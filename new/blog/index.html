      <h3>What have we actually done?</h3>
      <h4><em>4/12/2016</em></h4>
      <p>
        From Wednesday the 30th of November to Saturday the 3rd of December, various members of TGEnterprise worked at the Bournside Christmas production of "High School Musical", selling teas, coffes, sweets and sodie-pops to the audience members. This event, and the cash flow from it, has helped to kickstart the business, primarily by providing the money used to pay start-up fees. All money that didn't go to paying  of these fees went directly to the pockets of Mr Tommy G., even though he did little to no work. This caused even more resignations, especially amongst members whos origins lay amongst the lower classes.

      <h3>Controversy</h3>
      <h4><em>23/11/2016</em></h4>
      <p>
        On the 22nd of November 2016, our business suffered losses from which we may never recover. Secretary James W., as well as several other members, resigned over the controversial transition of TGEnterprise from democracy to dictatorship. As Tommy G. himself became the autocratic f√ºhrer, many felt that they could not maintain their roles in good faith. The resulting reshuffle may have long-reaching impacts for the future of the company. In the 'last vote' of the company, former IT Director Marley S. was voted into the position of Secretary, though many complained that this could not be considered a truly democratic vote, as only three member were allowed to vote, all of which were completely bias. Many also argued that the resignation of these members under such circumstances could be considered to be furthering the decrease of the reign of democracy.
