      TG Enterprise was founded on the 5th of October 2016, by Tommy G. himself, as well as his trusted board of directors. We meet every week, and are constantly trying to come up with anything remotely better than a hand on a bloody stick. Our current Managing Director is Marley Sudbury, who rules with an iron fist, alongside his Assistant Managing Director Jan Ilnicki.
